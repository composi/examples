### In Browseer Experience

One of the simple projects, composi-in-browser, shows how to use @composi/core in the browser. This takes advantage of the fact that modern browsers can now import ES6 modules. The project just needs to be run in the browser using a server such as NPM's [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
